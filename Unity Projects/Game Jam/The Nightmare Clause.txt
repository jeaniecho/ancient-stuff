-Nah go back to sleep (Results in game over - lazy ending)
-Run after dat boi
-Pull out your phone and google what to do

<Regardless of choice, other than choice 1>
You run downstairs and see seven reindeer. "Dasher, Dancer, Prancer, Comet, Cupid, Donner, Blitzen... ho ho ho who's missing?" //D2
-Split up and look for clues (Line 13)
-Ask master Rudolph (Line 15)
-Use your 200 IQ and realize Vixen is missing <line 43>

I should split up and look for clues! Santa, you check the empty stall. Santa, you ask Master Rudolph. Santa, you call Mrs. Clause for help. Okay! Go team! (Line 15) //D3

Suddenly, Master Rudolph approaches. "Yo boy, what's going down in the stables?" "Yo wassup you fat boy" Rudolph says "I'll tell you but first you gotta soup me, miniboss style." <INITIATES RUDOLPH MINIBOSS> //D4

<MINIBOSS>
Rudolph says "Alright yo, this is how its gonna work. I just got my fur softened, so I ain't gonna get all physical and hurt my complexion. I've got a date tonight with a babe. Anyway, We gon' trivia battle. Let's go. Question one: "From 1903 to 1958, every Pope–bar one–took which name?" //D5
-Billy <Rudolph kills you. Game over>
-Pius <Proceed to next question>
-Godfrey <Rudolph kills you. Game over>

"Damn, you good son. That was the warm up though. Next question: How many moles of sodium bicarbonate is needed to neutralize 0.80 ml of sulphuric acid?" //D6
-0.150mol <Rudolph kills you. Game over>
-0.015mol <Rudolph kills you. Game over>
-0.0150mol <Proceed to next question>

"Owie, you got me good there. Alright, try this one on for size! What color were the covers of the crime novels published in  the 1930s by Victor Gollancz?" //D7
-Red <death>
-Yellow <proceed>

"Hah, that was an easy one. Next up: Which actor paid $93,500 for the baseball which rolled between Bill Buckner’s legs in game six of the 1986 World Series?" //D8
-Charlie Sheen <Proceed>
-Jerry Seinfeld <death>

"Alright, that's it. I didn't want to have to do this to ya, but sometimes it just be like that. Time for my special move! What is the first line in the Bee Movie?" //D9
-According to all known laws of aviation, there is no possible way a bee should be able to fly. <death>
-According to all known laws of aviation, there is no way a bee should be able to fly. <correct, Rudolph dies. Proceed to (line 43)>
-According to all known laws of aviation, there isn't any way a bee should be able to fly. <death>

You glance down at the mangled body of Master Rudolph, and glance up towards the empty cell, i mean stable. "Oh its Vixen missing, duh" you say. //D10
-Call Mrs. Clause and be a responsible husband and tell her you're leaving (line 48)
-Go back to sleep <Game over, lazy ending>
-Head out on an epic quest to find Vixen (Line 50)

You pull out your cellphone and call Mrs. Clause. It rings 24 times before you hear her pick up. "WHAT" she screams. "Yo someone stole Vixen and rudolph is dead. I'm leaving", you respond. "k cool" she hangs up. (Line 50) //D11

You run to your room and grab the neccesities: A walkman and headphones, a Blaser R-93 Tactical, two energy bars, and a bowl full of jelly. Glancing around the room, you see you naughty list sitting open on a table. //D12
-Check the list (line 55)
-Check it twice (line 57)
-Leave (Line 59)

Approaching the list, you read the first name on the page. "Yoshi - for commiting tax fraud. Ho ho ho", you chant, "He'll never learn, that rascal." (Line 59) //D13

Approaching the list, you read the first name on the page. "Yoshi - for commiting tax fraud. Ho ho ho", you chant, "He'll never learn, that rascal.". You turn to leave, but before doing so you turn around again, just to make sure. Reading it again, you confirm Yoshi is infact guilty of tax fraud. (Line 59) //D14

You exit the building into the cold wintery weather. You quickly realize you have no idea who took Vixen. As you're about to give up, a stench wafts through the air into your nostrils. "hmm.. I recognize that putrid smell anywhere. Vixen's nearby." //D15
-Call for a cab (66)
-Run towards the smell <initiates running subplot - line 276>
-Cartwheel towards the smell(64)

You try cartwheeling, and immediately get a cramp in your arm and give up. Instead, you walk. <Initiates running subplot - line 276> //D16

You pull out your phone and click speeddial 4 - the cab company. Someone answers on the other end."Hi, thank you for calling the SexyTimeFast hotline. Unfortunately, all of our operators are currently busy with other calls. Please hold, and the next available operator will take your call." //D17
-Hang up and walk <Initiates Running subplot - line 276>
-Realize you dialed the wrong number and hang up <Initiates Taxi Subplot - Line 78>
-Wait for the next available operator. (71)

After a few minutes of waiting, an operator answers your call. "Hey there sweetie, my name's Veronica, what can I do for you today?" the operator asks. "Ho ho ho, I need a ride to find my putrid reindeer and thought I'd get a ride" you say. "Sure thing baby, I'll be right there" she says. (73) //D18

After a few more minutes of waiting, Veronica pulls up in a brand new 2018 Honda Civic. She rolls down the window and shouts to you "Hey baby! Hop on!" //D19
-Get in the passenger seat. <GAME OVER - KIDNAPPED. DONT TRUST STRANGERS>
-Change your mind and run towards the smell. <Initiates running subplot - line 276>
-Tell her you had the wrong number and call a taxi. <Initiates taxi subplot - Line 78>

<TAXI SUBPLOT>
On your cellphone, you click speeddial 5 - the number you are certain is the cab company. It rings, and a voice answers. "Thank you for calling 1-800-TAX-IIII. Whatchu got fam?". "Ho ho ho, I need me a caberino" you respond. "I gotchu bro, omw". Immediately after hanging up, he appears and you get in. "Where you going dude?" the driver says. //D20
-Smell that rotten stench? Follow it. (Line 84)
-I need to find my reindeer, Vixen. (line 84)
-Just drive. You'll know when we're there. (line 84)

"You got it fam" the driver says. The taxi begins driving and the two of you sit in silence. //D21
-"What's your name?" (89)
-"Do you know who I am?" (94)
-... (99)

"What's your name?" you say. The driver looks at you, a glare in his eyes. "The name's Yoshi." //D22
-"Did you really commit all that tax fraud?"(104)
-"What do you want from me?" (109)
-... (129)

"Do you know who I am?" you say. The driver looks at you, a glare in his eyes. "Do you know who I AM?!" he shouts. You look at him blankly for a few moments before it clicks... Yoshi. //D23
-"Did you really commit all that tax fraud?"(104)
-"What do you want from me?" (109)
-... (129)

"So, ain't gonna say anything to me?" You glance at the driver for the first time, before it clicks. You are staring at none other than Yoshi. //D24
-"Did you really commit all that tax fraud?"(104)
-"What do you want from me?" (109)
-... (129)

"Did you really commit all that tax fraud?", you ask. "Ha!" Yoshi laughs. "Don't act like you don't know. Don't act like you don't know when I'm sleeping, and when I'm awake. That you don't know if I've been bad or good... Well I haven't been good for goodness sake." //D25
-"What do you want from me?" (109)
-"You're getting what you deserve." (114)
-"Why did you do it?" (124)

"What do you want from me?" you ask. Yoshi pulls the taxi over and he looks deep into your eyes. "I need your help. I've done a bad thing." //D26
-"You're getting what you deserve." (114)
-"I ain't helping no criminal" (119)
-... (129)

"You're getting what you deserve." I spit back at him. "You don't understand - the tax fraud, it was also fraud! I didn't do it! I'm innocent!" //D27
-"You idiot, I see everything. I know you did it!" (129)
-"I don't believe you." (129)
-"You just told me you did a bad thing." (129)

"I ain't helping no criminal" you spit back at him. "You don't understand - the tax fraud, it was also fraud! I didn't do it! I'm innocent!" //D28
-"You idiot, I see everything. I know you did it!" (129)
-"I don't believe you." (129)
-"You just told me you did a bad thing." (129)

"Why did you do it?" You ask. "That's the thing! I didn't! The tax fraud WAS fraud! I'm innocent!" //D29
-"You idiot, I see everything. I know you did it!" (129)
-"I don't believe you." (129)
-"You just told me you haven't been good." (129)

"Someone hacked into your see-all system, and made it look like I committed the tax fraud! And now the FBI is after me! I need your help to clear my name and get my repuation back!" //D30
-"Why would someone want to ruin your repuation?" (134)
-"I don't believe you. There is no proof." (139)
-"Why should I help you?" (144)

"Why would someone want to ruin your reputation?" You ask, skeptically. "Why wouldn't they? I'm Yoshi! Im awesome!" he responds. //D31
-"Well, can't argue with that logic." (149)
-"I don't believe you. There is no proof." (139)
-"Why should I help you?" (144)

"I don't believe you. There is no proof." You stress. "Don't believe me? Take a look at your naughty list again." You summon your naughty list, and open it. Right there, on the front page, in big bold letters, is "SANTA". //D32
-"How did you do this?" (154)
-"Oh my god..." (159)
-... (159)

"Why should I help you?" You demand. "Because this affects you too. Take a look at your naughty list again." You summon your naughty list, and open it. Right there, on the front page, in big bold letters, is "SANTA". //D33
-"How did you do this?" (154)
-"Oh my god..." (159)
-... (159)

"This affects you too. Take a look at your naughty list again." You summon your naughty list, and open it. Right there, on the front page, in big bold letters, is "SANTA". //D34
-"How did you do this?" (154)
-"Oh my god..." (159)
-... (159)

"It wasn't me, it was a common enemy... An enemy-" suddenly, you are interrupted by sirens in the distance. "Oh no... they found me. Santa, I need your help. We have to fight these guys off!" //D35
-"I can't. I believen't you." (164)
-"I gotchu bro, let's soup them together" (174)
-"But what about Vixen? I need that smelly boy to deliver gifts in two days." (168)

"We have a common enemy. An enemy-" suddenly, you are interrupted by sirens in the distance. "Oh no... they found me. Santa, I need your help. We have to fight these guys off!" //D36
-"I can't. I believen't you." (164)
-Stay and fight the FBI <Initates the YOSHI ending - Line 174>
-"But what about Vixen? I need that smelly boy to deliver gifts in two days." (168)

"I can't. I believen't you." You tell him. Yoshi looks at you pleadingly. "You have to help me... They'll kill me..." //D37
-Leave to find Vixen <Initiate Vixen Ending - D246>
-Stay and fight the FBI <Initiate Yoshi Ending - Line 174>

"But what about Vixen? I need that smelly boi to deliver gifts in two days." You argue. "We'll find him together, but we won't do anything ever again if we don't soup these baddies!" //D38
-Leave to find Vixen <Initiate Vixen Ending w/ yoshi fight bc christina sucks - Line 246>
-Stay and fight the FBI <Initiate Yoshi Ending - Line 174>



<YOSHI ENDING>
You look at Yoshi and crack a smirk. "I gotchu fam, let's soup 'em." //D39
-Pull out your Blaser R-93 Tactical and prepare for battle (180)
-Grab Yoshi and get some cover (195)
-Stand your ground (190)

The FBI appears over the horizon, driving directly towards you. You zoom in with the scope of your Blaser R-93 Tactical, surveying the situation. //D40
-Aim for the leader and fire (184)
-Warn Yoshi of the oncoming danger (186)

You aim your crosshair over the person who looks to be in charge, take a deep breath and pull the trigger. It clicks. You look down in disbelief... No ammo. You look up into impending doom and are about to screen when suddenly you are shot dead. The same fate is soon bestowed upon Yoshi. <YOU DIED, GAME OVER> //D41

You tell Yoshi of the oncoming danger. "What do you wanna do? Should we get cover or should we fight?" Yoshi asks. //D42
-Fight (184)
-Get cover (195)

You stand your ground and the FBI trucks come to a halt in front of you. A fancy looking man steps out and walks up to you. "I've been looking for you for a while, Yoshi. Thought you could get Santa to help you, huh? Well not if I have anything to say about it. What say you?" //D43
-"We're gonna soup ya!" (213)
-Attack him (209)
-Shoot him with your Blaser R-93 Tactical (211)

You and Yoshi dive behind some bushes, and peak out. The FBI trucks stop in front of the bushes and a bunch of heavily armed men stand around the bush. A fancy looking man steps forward. "Yoshi. We know you're there. Come out." //D44
-Get out (204)
-Stay put (199)

The fancy man sighs and two FBI dudes pull you both out of the bush and set you down. "I've been looking for you for a while, Yoshi. Thought you could get Santa to help you, huh? Well not if I have anything to say about it. What say you?" //D45
-"We're gonna soup ya!" (213)
-Attack him (209)
-Shoot him with your Blaser R-93 Tactical (211)

You and Yoshi climb out of the bush and stand in front of the Fancy man. "I've been looking for you for a while, Yoshi. Thought you could get Santa to help you, huh? Well not if I have anything to say about it. What say you?" //D46
-"We're gonna soup ya!" (213)
-Attack him (209)
-Shoot him with your Blaser R-93 Tactical (211)

You lunge at him but before you can even get within arms reach, an FBI agent grabs you. "Put him down." The fancy man says "If he wants to soup, then I will soup him." (213) //D47

You pull out your Blaser R-93 Tactical and aim it at the Fancy man's head. "Prepare to be souped". You pull the trigger and only hear a click. You pull again. Another click. The Fancy man smiles. "Maybe bring ammo next time, bro", and with that you are shot dead. <GAME OVER> //D48

Before your very eyes, Fancy man transforms... into FINAL FANCY BOSS MAN!!! <INITIATE FINAL BOSS> //D49

"Time to be souped, friend." Final fancy boss man chortles. "You'll never soup us!" Yoshi shouts. "Us?" Final fancy boss man states, "This is only between Santa and I. Having inclusion from an NPC makes coding this scene a lot more difficult." "But... But... Fine." Yoshi sits down on a chair. "Now, Santa, be prepared to answer my questions correctly!" (217) //D50

"Question one: What does FBI stand for?" //D51
-Federal Bureau of Investigaion <Correct>
-Fabulous Boots, Indeed. <Death>
-It doesn't stand for anything, it's just FBI. <Death>

"Yeah, maybe that was too easy. How about this on for size then? We, the FBI, keep a lot of hair samples on file. How many do we have?" //D52
-500 <Death>
-2000 <Death>
-5000 <Correct>

"Fine, time to pull out the big guns: Which of the following celebrities had FBI files? Marilyn Monroe, Charlie Sheen, Donald Trump." //D53

"That's it. What president made it mandatory for FBI directors to serve terms?" //D54
-JFK <Death>

-A person who works at The Brick <Death>
-An FBI agent who works on the streets <Correct - line 242>
-A chemical used to retrieve fingerprints <Death>

The Final Fancy Boss Man clutches his chest and grunts. "You've souped me..." he says, and falls to the ground. The rest of the FBI kneel and praise you for destroying their leader. "Now you shall clear my name of any tax fraud allegations!!" Yoshi demands. The FBI salute, and march off in their trucks. "Now," you say, "Lets go find Vixen!". "Yeah! Let's-a-go!". The two of you run off to find Vixen. (244) //D56

A few hours later you show up at the source of the smell. In the distance, you notice a figure on the ground. Approaching it, you find Vixen, dead. You were too late. <THE END - YOSHI ENDING> //D57

<YOSHI FIGHT>
"No way bro, I ain't helpin you. I need my smelly boi, and I need him now." You say, turning to leave. You hear a shotgun cock, and turn around. Yoshi has a gun held to your head. "Not so fast, if you're leaving, you're getting souped." "Yoshi!" you gasp, "You're a miniboss?!" "You freakin' bet fam. Now get souped!" <INITIATES YOSHI MINIBOSS> //D58

"Lets do this, Santa. In what year did the IRS begin investigating tax fraud?" //D59

"Must've been a lucky guess. How much money is paid out each year to fraudulant tax claims?" //D60

-5.9 billion <Correct>

"Hey, how do you know so much about tax fraud? What's your SIN bro?" //D61
-165 841 0064 <Death>
-876 951 0320 <Death>
-I'm not giving you my SIN, Yoshi! <Correct>

 "Fine, I'll just pick it off your dead corpse. What state has the highest rate of tax fraud in the US?" //D62
 -Ohio <Death>
 -Texas <Death>
 -Florida <Correct>

 "I'm convinced you've done this before. In 2017 what percentage increase did the rate of identity theft undergo?" //D63
 -50% <Correct - line 274>
 -20% <Death>
 -It didn't increase, stupid <Death>

"Maaaan, how are you so good at tax fraud?! There's no way you're legit." By this point, the FBI was in sight. "Sorry Yoshi," you say, turning around, "You're on your own." With that you take the taxi and leave. After a few minutes of driving you turn around and watch the FBI gun down Yoshi. You look away and push onward toward Vixen. <INITIATE VIXEN ENDING - YOSHI DED> //D64

<RUNNING SUBPLOT>
Preparing yourself, you pop in your headphones and play a song on your walkman and head out into the arctic tundra. Following the smell, you make it a good distance before it starts to snow. All at once, your walkman dies, your visibility is gone, and your stomach starts rumbling. Reaching into your pocket, you pull out the two energy bars and the bowl full of jelly. //D65
-Eat an energy bar (282)
-Eat the jelly (287)
-Put them away (314)

Putting one of the energy bars in your pocket, along with the bowl full of jelly, you eat one of the energy bars. Best to have the most energy now before the storm gets worse. Once you finish, you look around. The snow has long since covered the smell, and Vixen could be anywhere. Where do you go? //D66
-Go forward (316)
-Stay put (292)
-Go back home (294)

Putting the energy bars in your pocket, you decide the jelly is the best thing to eat right now. Once you finish, you look around. The snow has long since covered the smell, and Vixen could be anywhere. Where do you go? //D67
-Go forward (320)
-Stay put (292)
-Go back home (298)

You decide hunkering down where you're at and waiting out the storm is the best idea. It works for a few hours, but eventually you start freezing. At this point, you realize it's too late to make another decision and you have to stick this out. Unfortunately, mother nature has different plans for you, and you begin to accept your fate. <GAME OVER - FROZE TO DEATH> //D68

You decide the storm is too bad to be caught in, and turn back towards home. However, you quickly realize you don't remember which way is home. You pick the direction you believe is home and wander. A few hours later, you're starving again. Reaching into your pocket, you discover the Jelly is completely frozen and inedible. This leaves you with only an energy bar. You... //D69
-Eat it (302)
-Put it away for later (314)

You decide the storm is too bad to be caught in, and turn back towards home. However, you quickly realize you don't remember which way is home. You pick the direction you believe is home and wander. A few hours later, you're starving again. Reaching into your pocket, you pull out the two energy bars. you.. //D70
-Eat one (304)
-Put them away for later away for later (314)

When you finish your energy bar, you continue on. After a while, you think you see the shape of a building. Excited, you sprint towards it, however it quickly becomes apparent that the figure is not your home. It's a polar bear! And it looks hungry! If only you still had food to give it. Unfortunately, you don't have any food left to offer him. Using your only option, you run. You end up losing the bear, but you're now hungry, cold and tired. Eventually you collapse from hunger, and your mistakes catch up with you. <GAME OVER - HUNGER'D TO DEATH> //D71

When you finish your energy bar, you continue on. After a while, you think you see the shape of a building. Excited, you sprint towards it, however it quickly becomes apparent that the figure is not your home. It's a polar bear! And it looks hungry! You reach into your pocket and pull out your last energy bar. //D72
-Offer it to the bear (310)
-Turn and run (308)

Running seems like the only option, so you run. You end up losing the bear, but you're now hungry, cold and tired. Eventually you eat your last bar, but the cold overcomes you and your mistakes catch up with you. <GAME OVER - FROZE TO DEATH> //D73

Offering the energy bar to the bear, he looks at it and then back down to the bar. He takes it and eats it. Seemingly satisfied, he tips his hat and turns to leave. Sighing, you contine on. Again, you begin to see a shape in the distance. Cautiously, you approach, and you're relieved to discover it is your house. You arrive home, and get some well needed sleep. (312) //D74

The next morning, now that the storm has passed, you can clearly smell Vixen again. You begin following the direction of the smell. Along the way, you pass the body of a green dinosaur, and the body of a lady you've never seen before. After a few hours, you come across the source of the smell: The figure of an animal, laying on the ground. Approaching it, you find Vixen, dead. You're too late. <EVERYONE IS DEAD ENDING> //D75

For some reason, you decide eating isn't important and you put your food away. This quickly becomes a problem, however, as food is required to live. This lack of judgement comes back to bite you, pardon the pun, and you collapse out of hunger. <YOU DIED - HUNGER'D TO DEATH> //D76

You decide there's no turning back now. Vixen needs you, and you're gonna help him. Walking forward for a few more hours, you begin to feel hungry again. Pulling out your food, you realize the jelly is completely frozen and no longer edible. This leaves you with only your energy bar. //D77
-Eat it (324)
-Put it away (314)

You decide there's no turning back now. Vixen needs you, and you're gonna help him. Walking forward for a few more hours, you begin to feel hungry again. Pulling out your food, you look at the two energy bars. //D78
-Eat one (326)
-Put them away (314)

Pushing onward, you see the shape of an animal laying in the snow. Approaching it, you see it's Vixen. He looks toward you and weakly smiles. "Santa, I knew you'd come for me!" he says, "Do you have any food? I'm starving". Reaching into your pocket, you realize you have nothing. Vixen gives you a half smile "...Oh, that's okay. At least you came for me...". Vixen lays his head on the ground and his eyes slowly close. A tear drops from your cheek and your rest a hand on his head. "You were good kid, real good." <EVERYONE DIES ENDING> //D79

Pushing onward, you see the shape of an animal laying in the snow. Approaching it, you see it's Vixen. He looks toward you and weakly smiles. "Santa, I knew you'd come for me!" he says, "Do you have any food? I'm starving". Reaching into your pocket, you pull out your final energy bar. Vixen looks thrilled and scarfs down the food. "Come on buddy, let's go find some shelter." (328) //D80

The two of you approach a nearby cave for shelter. It provides adequate protection from the snow, and thankfully has a fridge full of food. The two of you spend the night enjoying the food, and get some well-deserved sleep. <VIXEN ENDING - LINE 335> //D81

<VIXEN ENDING - YOSHI DED>
You see a figure in the snow in the distance. You stop the car and get out. Approaching it, you see it's Vixen. He looks toward you and weakly smiles. "Santa, I knew you'd come for me!" he says, "Do you have any food? I'm starving". Reaching into your pocket, you pull out an energy bar. Vixen looks thrilled and scarfs down the food.

<VIXEN ENDING>
The next morning, you wake up before Vixen does. You take a moment to survey the cave for the first time. Along with the fridge, you see other appliances which you didnt notice before. You take a moment to explore the room. (Line 338) //D84

Vixen begins to stir and you crouch down next to him. "Vixen... What happened? Who took you?" you demand. "It was--" Suddenly, a loud and deep voice is heard: "ME!". Turning around you spot... the Nightmare Clause. "I kidnapped your reindeer so I would always have a bit of Christmas with me!" He booms. "You left me in the snow to die!" Vixen cries. "Silence, deer. This fat man stole my food and infiltrated my home. Now he must be souped." (340) //D85

"Time for the Final final final boss!" Nightmare Clause booms. "First question: Christmas was banned in Boston from 1659 to 1681 because of what Christian group?" //D86
